## v0.146.0 Deprecations

### Template system restructured

Hugo v0.146.0 reimplements and simplifies the template system. The old layout conventions still work but are considered legacy and will eventually be removed. Upgrade your layouts directory as follows:

#### Remove `_default` directory

The `_default` directory is no longer needed. Move templates out of it:

- `layouts/_default/single.html` → `layouts/page.html`
- `layouts/_default/list.html` → `layouts/list.html`
- `layouts/_default/baseof.html` → `layouts/baseof.html`
- `layouts/_default/terms.html` → `layouts/taxonomy.html`
- `layouts/_default/taxonomy.html` → `layouts/term.html` (note: the old naming was confusing — what was called "taxonomy" in `_default` actually rendered individual terms)

#### Rename `single` to `page`

The layout name `single` is now `page`:

- `layouts/_default/single.html` → `layouts/page.html`
- `layouts/posts/single.html` → `layouts/posts/page.html`

#### Add underscore prefix to `partials` and `shortcodes`

The `partials` and `shortcodes` directories now use an underscore prefix:

- `layouts/partials/` → `layouts/_partials/`
- `layouts/shortcodes/` → `layouts/_shortcodes/`

#### Rename `index.html` for home page

The home page template `index.html` is now `home.html`:

- `layouts/index.html` → `layouts/home.html`

#### Baseof template naming

The baseof template naming convention has changed. The identifier that was hyphen-prepended before `baseof` is now dot-appended after it:

- `layouts/_default/list-baseof.html` → `layouts/baseof.list.html`
- `layouts/docs/list-baseof.html` → `layouts/docs/baseof.list.html`

#### Summary of common migrations

| `layouts/_default/list-baseof.html` | `layouts/baseof.list.html` |
